# Introduction
This section contains various backend microservices of the practice projects.

Inside here you will find integrations to third party software, mocks for testing with the frontend.

Ideally, everything here will be written in either Go/ Python as these are the 2 core languages I'm practising.

As the journey continue, I might bring in more languages such as solidity/ rust.
